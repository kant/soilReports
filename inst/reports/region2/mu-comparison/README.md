## Map Unit Comparison/Summary Report

[Download the pdf files from the docs folder of this GitHub page](https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilReports/tree/master/docs), for background and instructions for the Map Unit Summary Report and instructions for the MLRA Comparison Report.

This report was designed to assist with comparisons between map unit concepts via sampling of various raster data sources within map unit polygons. Configuration of data sources is done within `config.R`. Contact Dylan Beaudette (dylan.beaudette at ca.usda.gov) for questions or comments.

## Troubleshooting
1. Make sure that all raster data sources are [GDAL-compatible formats](http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html): GeoTiff, ERDAS IMG, ArcGRID, etc. (not ESRI FGDB)
2. Make sure that the map unit polygon data source is an [OGR-compatible format](http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html): ESRI SHP, ESRI FGDB, etc.
